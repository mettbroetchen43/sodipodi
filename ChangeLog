    * src/helper/sodipodi-ctrl.*: removed aa rendering

2000-01-18 David Metcalfe (crdjm@sgi.com)

    * Added command line options:
     . [ -f ] file  to load file at startup
     . -p file      to print the file without the GUI starting
     . -t file      to send the print output to the named file
    * -t is currently required for -p as I couldn't find a way of creating
        a GnomePrinter that goes to the default printer. ??
    * Printing doesn't require that X be started

1999-09-02  Lauris Kaplinski <lauris@ariman.ee>

    * Rewrote many things and hacked up the rest.
    Removed Gdome dependency, as I had neither time nor patience
    to mess with it. As a temporary solution I've created SPRepr objects,
    which can contain xml data.
    Added functions: group, ungroup, delete, duplicate, to_front,
    to_back, up, down
    Freehand drawing almost works although need some cleanup
    Outlines are implemented, although not usable yet
    Rect can handle round corners i hope
    Ellipse can be sliced
