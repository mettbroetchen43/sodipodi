2000/09/01 Version 0.16

Imported to CVS.
Added multiple files / multiple views support. As a result, most things
do not work any more, but you can experiment with load/save/print/import,
group/ungroup, delete/duplicate, transforming, node editing, drawing,
rects, ellipses and text. Sometimes it does not crash.

30.12.1999 Node editing now works!
