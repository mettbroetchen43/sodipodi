2000/10/09 Version 0.20

This release is intended to test the whole thing out before Gnome 1.4 release
later this year.
We have completely new interface, GnomeMDI is gnome, bonobo embeddable works in
limited way, there are guidelines, grid and countless other improvements.

2000/05/04 Version 0.18

This is still development release. Many bugs, some of whose are very nasty
memory corrupting ones are lurking around.
Undo/Redo now basically work. Undo is unlimited, so you are encouraged to
test, how long it takes to fill all memory...
There are also some minor improvements, such as (preliminary) way to print
semi-transparent pixmaps.

2000/28/03 Version 0.17

Sodipodi home is now http://sodipodi.sourceforge.net/
Started building regular tarballs and RPMs
Created icon & desktop entry
etc. etc.

2000/14/01 Version 0.16

Started hacking with GnomeMDI. You can fire up fill & stroke dialogs again
and these even update itself, if active view changes.

2000/09/01 Version 0.16

Imported to CVS.
Added multiple files / multiple views support. As a result, most things
do not work any more, but you can experiment with load/save/print/import,
group/ungroup, delete/duplicate, transforming, node editing, drawing,
rects, ellipses and text. Sometimes it does not crash.

30.12.1999 Node editing now works!
