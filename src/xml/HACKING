This is placeholder for DOM. It will replaced as soon as:

1. RPM-s of gdome are available in standard GNOME distribution
2. gdome support at least following events:
   destroy (preprocess, not sure if this is necessary)
   child_inserted (postprocess - args: parent, child...)
   child_remove (preprocess - args: parent, child...)
   attr_changed (postprocess)
   content_changed (postprocess)
If you have idea, how to implement xml backbone with different / differently
   behaving events, things can change.

As first step I will one day model reprs more like DOM. Something like:
sp_repr_new -> sp_repr_doc_create_element
sp_repr_add_child -> sp_repr_node_insertbefore
sp_repr_copy -> sp_repr_node_clone
etc.
These declarations will probably go to repr-dom-test.h header
