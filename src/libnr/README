LibNR

This is collection of RGB(A) rendering utilities.

The code is in public domain, except linear gradient
renderer, which contains code developed while working
at Ximian.
So you can do whatever with the code here, including
sub-licensing it etc. etc.
If you want your changes to be included in
Sodipodi/LibNR, you have to put these in public
domain as well.
