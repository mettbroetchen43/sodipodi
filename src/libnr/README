LibNR

This is collection of RGB(A) rendering utilities.

The code is in public domain, i.e. not copyrighted.
OK, I understand that it does not make any sense
under Berne convention, but this is the way I'd like
it to be. In any case you can do whatever you want
with this code, so it really does not make any
difference.

If you want your changes to be included in
Sodipodi/LibNR, you have to put these in public
domain as well.
