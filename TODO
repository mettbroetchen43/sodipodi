Miscellaneous ideas

Tier 1 TODO items

* Gradients (linear ones mostly work, have to dor radial ones too)
* CORBA based plugins
* Accesible groups - i.e. instead of layers, we can edit different groups
* Bonobo container - we can get rid of images and still be SVG :)

Tier 2 TODO items

* Intelligent curve editing
* Show/hide/print/dontprint attributes
* Agnostic DOM CORBA interface - i.e. repr tree
* Gnostic DOM CORBA interface - i.e. document tree
* Gnostic and agnostic object editors

File formats

* General plugin-based file format support
* Disable xmlns:sodipodi if pure SVG is preferred
* Corel
* AI
* Sketch
* Dia

Interesting, but otherwise useless :)

* Distributed agnostic documents
* Edit SVG part of any document

Done

* Undo
* Middle object level
* Page size
* Fonts - but we need some good library for reading outlines - and how to
  do it portably?
* NamedViews - i.e. saved views into document (preserving guides etc.)
* Guidelines
* Aligning
