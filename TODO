  do it portably?
* Undo
* etc. etc.

Tier 2

Idea for next major rewrite - Middle object level
This is partially implemented (2000/01/09)

Currently we have 2 levels of objects - untyped reprs and typed editables.
Actually the basic state preserving level should go to intermediate typed
layer. Canvas items should be only paper-thin wrappers and reprs will be
what they are. Among other thing this allows multiple displays (i.e. multiple
canvases) & seems generally a cleaner design.
All methods not directly concerend with canvas will go to intermediate
object hierarchy (print, bbox, read etc.)
