Sodipodi

Sodipodi is (or at least should be) an vector illustrator program for GNOME
environment. It is currently in active development and not usable for any
real work.

If you are interested in production quality program, try sketch
http://www.sourceforge.org/sketch

If you are more interested in hacking, you can also try out KIllustrator,
Gill and GYVE. Sodipodi eagerly borrows code from every other free program
under the Sun (hey - isn't it the main point about free software?)

You can always find the freshest sodipodi at GNOME CVS.

Compiling should be trivial, but I cannot guarantee that it works on any other
system aside mine:

./configure
make
make install

You need reasonably recent libglade ang gdk-pixbuf.
If you have very fresh gnome-print, you should manually comment out libspgt1
in src/Makefile.am.

If you modify sodipodi in any usable way, please let me know also.

Some demo pictures could have absolute paths for imported images. So if they
do not display correctly, tune them with a good text editor.

Some guidelines:
Node editing does not update xml objects correctly yet. So before saving
anything switch to selection mode.
Ctrl & Shift modify dragging behaviour in some modes
Shift click usually toggles selection
To break line (or add node) select its endpoints
It should import png, bmp, jpg, xpm & gif bitmaps and svg vector images.
Open can handle only svg graphics
It does not yet handle following svg shapes:
- line
- polyline
- polygon (use path instead)
- circle
- square?
When importing svg, all paths are usually grouped. Ungroup these manually.
To add more fonts, please tinker with font-wrapper.c & text-dialog.c
